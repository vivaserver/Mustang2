# Mustang2 colorscheme, improving the improved

So, after a year-ish using console VIM the Mustang2 colorscheme proved to me a nice match for my coding, Ruby mostly.

I like code folding and tabs, so this fork just adds some color definitions and customizations for both. See for yourself:

this is a small edit of the Mustang Vim Colorscheme by hcalves. He deserves all the credit, find him and screenshots here: http://hcalves.deviantart.com/art/Mustang-Vim-Colorscheme-98974484 

My edits are basically only making the search highlighting look better.

Honestly this theme was love at first sight for me, you should try it too.
